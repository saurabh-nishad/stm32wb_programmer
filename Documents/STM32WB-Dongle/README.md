## Intoduction
 The STM32WB is a multiprotocol wireless and ultra-low-power device embeds a powerful and ultra-low-power radio compliant with the Bluetooth® Low Energy SIG specification v5.0 or with IEEE 802.15.4-2011. It contains a dedicated Arm® Cortex® -M0+ for performing all the real-time low layer operation.  
 
 The devices are designed to be extremely low-power and are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 64 MHz. The Cortex®-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision that supports all Arm® single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) that enhances application security. Enhanced inter-processor communication is provided by the IPCC with six bidirectional channels. The HSEM provides hardware semaphores used to share common resources between the two processors.       
 
 ### - The STM32WBx5 wireless microcontrollers, available in multiple packages and different memory sizes, provide users with enhanced performance and flexibility to address different levels of complexity.     
 ### - The STM32WBx0 Value Line focuses on the essentials and offers a feature-optimized, cost-effective solution for developers.

This is tool describe basic to start the setup and stack & FUS falshing to the STM32WBxx.
